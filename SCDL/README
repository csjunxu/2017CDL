% Semi-Coupled Dictionary Learning for Super-Resolution
% Author: Shenlong Wang, NPU/HK POLYU

% Latest Update: 27, Sept 2012
	1. Two bugs have been revised. 
	2. Training sample are included in the Data folder. 

% This code is for the paper:
% S. Wang, L. Zhang, Y. Liang and Q. Pan, "Semi-coupled Dictionary Learning 
% with Applications in Super-resolution and Photo-Sketch Synthesis", in CVPR 2012. 
% It has been tested on 64-bit LINUX. 

% Thanks Dr. Weisheng Dong for providing some useful MATLAB functions including clustering and nonlocal block matching. 
% The sparse coding algorithm used in this package is from SPAMS toolbox [2]. Please make sure that the toolbox has been 
% successfully installed in your computer. 


% 1. If you want to reproduce super-resolution experiment, Please run Image_SR directly. 
% 2. If you want reproduce dictionary learning procedures, please run Dict_Train directly. 
% 3. If you want to collect image patches from your own training data, please refer to collectPatches. 
% 4. If you want to adopt our semi-coupled dictionary framework in your own tasks, please call the coupledDL function in our code. 
% But please note that an initialization is necessary and please refer to our paper for initialization method.
